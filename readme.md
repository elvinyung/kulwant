# Kulwant
### by [Elvin Yung](https://github.com/elvinyung)

A webserver is built!

A very, very simple webserver built in bash, using `netcat` for network I/O.

**Warning:** Only tested on OSX. I think `netcat` usage is slightly different for Linux (something about the `-p` flag), so caveat emptor. Or, I guess, caveat ademptor.

### Instructions
```shell
./kulwant.sh PORT DIRECTORY_TO_SERVE
```
